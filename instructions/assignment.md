# Assignment: Multimodal Image Generation

## 📝 What You Need to Do

1. Open the notebook in `notebooks/Multimodal_Image_Generation_Exercise.ipynb`.
2. Run all cells to generate and explore AI-generated images.
3. Experiment with prompts and the `guidance_scale` value.
4. Answer the reflection questions from the PDF worksheet in a separate document (or at the end of the notebook).
