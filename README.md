# Multimodal Image Generation Lab

This lab introduces multimodal learning by guiding students to generate images from text prompts using diffusion models.

## 📘 Contents

- `notebooks/`: The main Jupyter notebook for hands-on activities.
- `docs/`: A PDF worksheet with reflection questions and prompts.
- `instructions/`: Assignment setup and submission guidelines.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Google Colab)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand how multimodal inputs (text + images) are encoded
- Learn the basics of Stable Diffusion for image generation
- Reflect on how prompt tuning affects generated outputs

## 🛠️ Setup

Run the notebook in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment with `diffusers`, `transformers`, and `torch` installed.

## ✅ Submission Instructions

Refer to the `instructions/assignment.md` file for how to complete and submit your work.
