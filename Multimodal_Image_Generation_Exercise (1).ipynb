    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of multimodal learning and diffusion-based image generation.\n",
    "- Generate images using Stable Diffusion with Hugging Faceâ€™s `diffusers` library.\n",
    "- Reflect on how prompts and model parameters influence the generated outputs.\n"
